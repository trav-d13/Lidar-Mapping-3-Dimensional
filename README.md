# Lidar-Mapping-3-Dimensional

Prokect aim is to 3-D map a space utilizing a servo-stepper motor combination to provide complete 3-dimensional control, whilst a LIDAR module measures distances at each point. 
The space can then be utilizing a custom mapping program. 

#### Initial phases of the project.
- Basic Light Sensitive Resistor use
- Use of 2 LSR and stepper mtor to align with target light source. 
- Basic stepper motor 360 degree movement.
- Basic servo motor 180 degrees. 
- Communication between motor and servo such that LIDAR module knows to perform measurement.
- Basic LIDAR module use
- Lidar use in 2-D using Stepper motor 
- Rendering software for 2-Dimensional use
- Improve 2-D physical movement to 3-D
- Improve 3-D modelling software to 3-D
